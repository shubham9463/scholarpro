          When we draw, we use our brains. This helps to actively use both sides
          of the brain equally. It helps to develop strategic thinking and focus
          better on different aspects in life. Drawing is a means that allows
          individuals to self-reflect upon their thinking and ideas. It is used to
          externalize emotions, which is very personal. As children release their
          emotions while drawing, they even discover few things about themselves.
          Thus, drawing is also called a journey of self-discovery. Parents and
          teachers can understand the psyche of children to take appropriate
          actions. It also tests their aptitude and lets elders know the areas
          children are good at.
