        <h2>Drawing Monthly Practice Test Series Class 6</h2>
        <p>
          Minds Marathon conducts monthly tests in the form of Drawing Olympiad
          Class 6. Here students are invited every month to be a part of the
          test and practice for the annual Olympiad. It ensures that students
          are regularly in touch with the drawing and there is a regular
          practice too. When students practice on a daily basis, students train
          their mind to release and make new connections. It opens new pathways
          and avenues to all children. When students draw, they naturally use
          both sides of the brain. Thus, makes them better in creativity and
          even in logical reasoning. This further strengthens their mind to
          focus strategically.
        </p>
        <p>
          Minds Marathon gradually introduces students to create a meaning and a
          visual effect from their drawings. They are taught how to give life to
          common objects such as flowers, vegetables, fruits, animals, birds,
          and nature. Students who practice drawing get connected deeply to the
          world around us. They develop brain-hand-eye co-ordination that is
          good for the psychic well-being of all individuals. The monthly tests
          are simply the best way to bring the best out of all participants.
          Drawing is one subject where students will require a lot of practice.
          Thus, the monthly Olympiads would provide them the required practice
          and exposure well before the main exam.
