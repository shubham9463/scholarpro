          The class 6 English International Olympiad conducted by Minds Marathon
          is a national exam. Here, students are tested on the same topics that
          are taught in class. Learning English language serves the purpose of
          using it for variety of purposes in the future. We give life to
          languages when it is spoken and written in a perfect manner. It
          becomes alive when contexts are made using words and phrases.
          Perfection in any language is acquired when we give our complete
          attention on the meaning, apart from its form. Class 6 English
          Olympiad builds up language abilities through variety of exercises on
          the basis of school syllabus. The questions asked here are framed from
          the curriculum prescribed by the CBSE, ICSE and other State boards.

          reading capabilities.

          English Olympiad exam develops reading habit through story-telling,
          re-telling, oral reading, shared reading etc. Teachers and parents
          must encourage children to read poems, understand the richness of the
          language, rhythm and choice of words. Some of the important topics
          covered in class 6 Olympiads are determiners, parts of speech,
          subject-verb agreement, sentence structures, modals and nouns. The
          Olympiad exam questions are developed by giving proper examples and
          details in a logical and systematic manner. The written content must
          support the main idea that is expressed in the topic. Students who
          attempt the English exam must learn to write sentences in differing
          lengths. The construction of all sentences must make the paragraph
          interesting. To avoid monotonous reading, it is important to add
          variety to the paragraph. Olympiad exams teach students to generate
          coherence in their writings. Students are taught to arrange all points
          in a logical manner.
