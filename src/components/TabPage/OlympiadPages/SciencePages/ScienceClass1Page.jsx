        <h2>ANNUAL OLYMPIAD</h2>
        <p style={{ fontSize: "18px", lineHeight: 1.3, color: "#333" }}>
 Annual Olympiads are organized by Minds Marathon every year to welcome
        talent from different schools. It allows students to come together and
        showcase their skills on national and international platforms. They are
        conducted both online as well as offline. Both these exams are open to
        students from class 1. It is indeed an honor for parents to see kids as
        young as 5 or 6-years old to participate at such a prestigious level.
        Students of class 1 can opt to participate in Annual Olympiads for
        International Science Olympiad (ISO).        </p>

          <p>
        Minds Marathon encourages students of grade 1 to become thorough in
        concepts taught in class. This can be done only when they are exposed to
        different competitions. The Annual exams are held for a duration of 45
        minutes (online) and 65 minutes (offline). Except for the Drawing exam,
        which is held for 60 minutes, and the Essay exam, which is held for 40
        minutes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Similar to the monthly exams, the Online Annual Olympiad can be taken
        from home using any tablet or smartphone. Students can take these exams
        at their convenience anytime between 10:00 am and 6:00 pm. The annual
        Olympiad exams consist of 35 questions for class 1 to class 4 and 50
        questions for class 5 to class 10 that have to be answered within the
        given time limit. These questions are all asked in the multiple-choice
        format. Students have four options to choose from, out of which one
        would be the correct answer and the other three would be distractors.
        When children of class 1 think which option would suit the most, they
        analyze why the other options would probably be wrong. This learning
        methodology helps them to differentiate from the other options and
        become confident about the right answer.
