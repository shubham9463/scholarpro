        <p>
          The syllabus for Social Studies Olympiad Class 9 is the same that is
          prescribed by the school. Students are encouraged to study the same

          question at the end of the chapter to analyze their understanding of
          the chapter. Olympiad exams do not encourage mugging up topics,
          instead it makes students remember in an easier manner. Students can
          relate their answers to daily life examples, prepare mnemonics for
          their reference and hunt for ways in which study becomes a pleasurable
          experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is advised to make full-fledged notes for attempting questions from
          the syllabus, as the paper includes important dates that go across
          centuries. Look for summaries in the textbooks. Make use of mind maps,
          charts and graphs. Students can review important term list and take
          practice tests from time to time. The other tricks that will help you
          to remember things and make preparation fun are to convert words to
          pictures, use memory spots, work specifically on names, use pictorial
          storage to remember list of items and most importantly study at your
          own individual pace.
