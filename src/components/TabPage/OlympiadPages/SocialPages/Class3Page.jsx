            subjects such as history, geography, civics, politics and want to know
            more about the world. This exam is important as it makes students
            improve their existing knowledge. Class 3 is a stepping stone for
            students in their primary education. Here, students get to learn
            different concepts that they can carry with themselves in the years to
            come. Students need to understand different topics otherwise it is
            difficult for them to cope up with higher studies. Without having a
            strong command over social studies, it is difficult for students to
            score good marks in the overall exams. Thus, it indirectly affects the
            overall performance of the students. Class 3 students must prepare well
            for their social studies. One way to do this is to enroll themselves
            for the Olympiad exams conducted by Minds Marathon. This exam gives
            them the required support, training and idea to prepare for similar
            questions.
